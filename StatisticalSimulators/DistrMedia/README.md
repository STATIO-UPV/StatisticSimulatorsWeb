STATIO: Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean Simulator

This simulator is part of [STATIO](https://statio.webs.upv.es), the Educational Innovation and Improvement Project (PIME/25-26/562) developed by the DEIOAC–[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es).

# Description
This application is an interactive simulator designed to visualize and understand the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean. It allows students and users to generate a target population based on different distributions (Normal, Uniform, or Asymmetric) and take repeated samples of a specific size ($n$). Users can observe the resulting distribution of the sample means, their dispersion, and compare the empirical results with a Normal model using histograms and Q-Q plots.
